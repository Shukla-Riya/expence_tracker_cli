# Expense Tracker CLI 💰

## Description
A simple, efficient Python tool for tracking personal expenses directly from the command line. This project demonstrates core Python concepts by using **File Handling** and the **CSV module** for data persistence, eliminating the need for a complex SQL database setup. It focuses on building strong logic and defensive programming skills.

## Features
* **Add Expenses:** Interactive menu to log date, category, and amount.
* **View History:** Read and display your total spending history from the persistent CSV file.
* **Data Persistence:** Automatically saves data to `expenses.csv` so records are not lost.
* **Defensive Design:** Robust error handling (`try...except`) prevents crashes from invalid user input.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.12
* **Libraries:** `csv` (Standard Library)
* **Concepts:** File I/O, Error Handling, CSV Manipulation

## Future Improvements
* Add data analysis (e.g., total spent per category).
* Implement a search feature by date.
